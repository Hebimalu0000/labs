PhET Interactive Simulations is a project at the University of Colorado Boulder that creates free interactive math and science simulations. The simulations are written as Java Applets and have been used by millions of students and teachers worldwide. With CheerpJ, these simulations have been brought to the web, making them accessible to a wider audience. CheerpJ allows Java Applets to also run on Chrome Books, tablets, iOS and any other environment that is not easily Java-enabled.

On PhETâ€™s website, you can find 50+ Java simulations made with CheerpJ, that help student and teachers explore important physics, chemistry, and math concepts.
