This tutorial will guide you on the basic functionalities of the Applet Runner extension. We assume you have installed the extension on [Chrome](/cheerpj-applet-runner/getting-started/install-chrome) or [Edge](/cheerpj-applet-runner/getting-started/install-edge) and you have already [activated your license](/cheerpj-applet-runner/getting-started/licensing).

## The home screen

When the Applet Runner extension detects that a Applet file has been triggered it will show the screen below in a new tab. This screen displays a few options alongside the license's owner and the Applet filename.

<div class="mx-24">![](/cheerpj3/assets/applet-screenshots/homescreen.png)</div>

### Start application button

If this button is selected, the Applet Runner will start executing your Java application, you will see a loading screen and after just a few seconds you will see your application running in the browser.

### Download file button

This button starts a download of your Applet file directly to your machine.

### Start automatically next time

You can skip the home screen and directly start running your Java applications next time by checking this option.
