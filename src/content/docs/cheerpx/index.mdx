**CheerpX is a browser-based runtime for executing native 32-bit executables and full operating systems, entirely client-side.** Apps that required cloud VMs to run can now be executed directly in the browser, without any server-side component.

CheerpX enables you to run existing native applications:

- without modifications;
- without recompilation;
- without source-code;
- fully client-side.

CheerpX is perfect for web-based IDEs, programming tutorials, virtual machines, and interactive demos. It can also be used to provide a secure sandbox for untrusted code. CheerpX is used by [WebVM](https://webvm.io/), [PythonFiddle](https://pythonfiddle.leaningtech.com/), and has been fully tested in production as part of [CheerpX for Flash](/cheerpx/for-flash), an enterprise solution to run legacy Adobe Flash content in the browser.

If you're looking to run Java in the browser, check out [CheerpJ](/cheerpj).

## How it works

CheerpX includes an x86-to-WebAssembly JIT compiler, a virtual block-based filesystem, and a Linux syscall emulator.

## CheerpX versus cloud VMs

CheerpX is a client-side solution, which means that the code is executed directly in the browser, without any server-side component. This has several advantages:

- **Cost effective.** CheerpX utilises client-side compute. No need to pay by the minute for cloud VMs.
- **Improved user experience.** No latency. Works offline. Performant even in poor network conditions.
- **Private.** User data never leaves their browser.
- **Secure.** No risk of bad actors running malicious code on your servers.
- **Scales to millions.** Leverages the power of the client's device. No need to provision servers.

## CheerpX versus WebContainers

WebContainers [can only execute languages that are natively supported on the Web](https://webcontainers.io/guides/troubleshooting#cannot-load-native-addon-error). In practice, this means only Node.js or WebAssembly can be executed. CheerpX supports any x86 executable and operating system.
