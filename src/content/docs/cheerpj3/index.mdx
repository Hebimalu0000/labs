## What is CheerpJ?

CheerpJ is a combination of two components:

1. An optimising Java-to-JavaScript JIT compiler.
2. A full Java SE 8 runtime.

Both are written in C++ and are compiled to WebAssembly & JavaScript using [Cheerp](/cheerp).

## What is unique about CheerpJ?

1. CheerpJ can handle 100% of Java 8, including Swing, reflection and dynamic class loading with no manual intervention on the code.
2. CheerpJ works directly on Java bytecode, and does not require access to the Java source code.
3. CheerpJ comes with a full Java SE runtime, inclusive of Swing/AWT. It supports audio, printing, and any other Java SE features. The runtime supports WebAssembly for optimal performance and size.
4. The JavaScript code generated by CheerpJ is highly optimised and garbage-collectible.
5. CheerpJ enables bidirectional Java-JavaScript interoperability. JavaScript libraries, as well as the DOM, can be called and manipulated from Java. Also, Java modules can be invoked from JavaScript.
6. CheerpJ supports Java multi-threading. In addition, it allows to create concurrent applications by using WebWorkers.
