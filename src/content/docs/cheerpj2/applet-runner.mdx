The CheerpJ Applet Runner is a browser extension that enables Java applets without requiring a local Java installation or to install deprecated plugins.

Since Java Applets have lost support on the majority of browsers, a tremendous amount of content, particularly in science and education, is virtually inaccessible. We aim at solving this problem by providing a solution to extend the life of Java applets on modern browsers.

## Installation

CheerpJ Applet Runner is available for Chrome and Edge.

<div class="flex flex-wrap gap-3">
  <LinkButton
    type="primary"
    href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cheerpj-applet-runner/bbmolahhldcbngedljfadjlognfaaein"
    label="Add to Chrome"
    iconLeft="openmoji:chrome"
  />

  <LinkButton
    type="primary"
    href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cheerpj-applet-runner/ebfcpaoldmijengghefpohddmfpndmic"
    label="Add to Microsoft Edge"
    iconLeft="openmoji:edge"
  />
</div>

## Usage

1. [Install CheerpJ Applet Runner](#installation)
2. Visit a page with a Java applet, [such as this one](http://www.neilwallis.com/projects/java/water/index.php)
3. Click on the CheerpJ Applet Runner icon in the toolbar
4. Click the **Enable CheerpJ** button

That's it!

## How it works

CheerpJ Applet Runner works by converting the Java Applet on the fly through [CheerpJ](/cheerpj2), a minimal Java-bytecode-to-JavaScript compiler, and linking it to the CheerpJ runtime environment.

The compiler runs directly on your browser and doesn't transmit your applet or the URL you are visiting to any external server.

The CheerpJ Applet Runner is not a plugin, and therefore does not pose any security threat, unlike the Java plugin.

## Bugs and questions
 
We welcome any feedback and bug report, either through the Extension/Add-On itself (click on icon + "Report bug") or on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/leaningtech/cheerpj-appletrunner/issues).
 
We aim at supporting as many Java applets as possible, and eventually Java WebStart applications.

## Privacy

CheerpJ Applet Runner is **completely private.** It communicates with no external servers. 100% of code execution is happening locally on the JavaScript engine of your browser. We don't collect information on the web pages
you are visiting, and the extension doesn't keep any logs.

## Pricing

CheerpJ Applet Runner is **free to use** on any publicly available Java applet.

If you want to use the CheerpJ Applet Runner within a private network, or for other commercial purposes, please [get in touch](https://leaningtech.com/contact-us/?subject=CheerpJ%20Applet%20Runner%20Licensing#mailus).
