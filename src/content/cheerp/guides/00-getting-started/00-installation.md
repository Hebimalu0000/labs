# heading 1

The purpose of this page is setting the basics of working with Cheerp, getting to the compilation of a "Hello World" example program and pointing to further reading and recommended tutorials.

This is the table of contents:

- [Install](#install "Install")
- [Cheerp basics](#cheerp-basics "Cheerp basics")
- [Ready?](#ready "Ready?")
- [Hello, World!](#hello-world "Hello, World!")
- [Tutorials](#tutorials "Tutorials")

## Install

Precompiled packages are available for [Ubuntu/Debian](Ubuntu-Debian-installation-using-PPA "Ubuntu/Debian apt packages"), [Windows](Windows-and-macOS-installation#windows "Windows binaries") or [macOS](Windows-and-macOS-installation#macos "macOS binaries").

Otherwise go to the [build instructions](Linux-build-instructions "Linux build instruction") to build directly from sources.

### Cheerp basics

- Cheerp is command line compatible with clang++/g++ compilers (to be invoked by developers or build tools)

Linux/macOS: `/opt/cheerp/bin/clang++ -target cheerp file.cpp -O3 -o target.js`

Windows: `C:\cheerp\bin\clang++ -target cheerp file.cpp -O3 -o target.js`

Most arguments are exactly the same, while [cheerp specific options](Cheerp-specific-clang-options) are prefixed by `cheerp`.

- Cheerp compiles from C/C++ sources to a mix of JavaScript, WebAssembly and ams.js

The first few examples will concentrate on pure JavaScript since it's conceptually easier, moving on to Wasm and asm.js later in the tutorials.

- The generated files requires no postprocessing and can be put to use directly in a web page or called by any JavaScript engine.

## Ready?

Cheerp in itself has no dependencies, but the recommended workflow and the tutorials make use of:

- a JavaScript engine
- an Http server
- a browser

The tutorials require very basic usage of a command line and use Unix notations, but it should be easy to translate to other environments.
You could check [Getting ready](Getting-ready) and come back here in a few minutes when everything is set.

Now we test if everything is set:

1. open the Terminal of your choice
2. `opt/cheerp/bin/clang++ --version` (`C:\cheerp\bin\clang++ --version` on Windows systems)
3. `nodejs --version`
4. `http-server -o`

All set? Go!

## Hello, World!

You are now ready for compiling your first Web application using Cheerp.
Move to a folder of your choice and save the following C++ program as `hello.cpp`. ([link](tutorials/hello_world/hello.cpp))

```cpp
// The cheerp/clientlib.h header contains declarations for the browser APIs
#include <cheerp/clientlib.h>

// webMain is the entry point for web applications written in Cheerp
void webMain()
{
        client::console.log("Hello, World Wide Web!");
}
```

You can then compile this program using the following command line:

```
/opt/cheerp/bin/clang++ -target cheerp hello.cpp -o hello.js
```

Great, you have compiled your first program with Cheerp. You can now run the generated JavaScript directly with

```
nodejs hello.js
```

You can also save this HTML file as `hello.html` ([link](tutorials/hello_world/hello.html))

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<title>Cheerp example 0: hello</title>
		<script defer src="hello.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1 id="pagetitle">
			Open the console log (Ctrl + Shift + J or Ctrl + Option + J) to read the
			output
		</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

and from the same folder `firefox hello.html` (or equivalent).

This is what the result should look like: [hello.html](tutorials/hello_world/hello.html)

[Why `webMain()` instead of `main()`?](Cheerp-basics#the-webmain-entry-point)

[What is `console.log()`?](Cheerp-basics#what-is-clientconsolelog)

It would have compiled also with `std::cout<< `, `printf()` or `int main()` (try it yourself), but we wanted to show first what zero-overhead access to the browser looks like.

## Tutorials

Now that you completed the first tutorial, we advise to going through the others to aquire some important knoledge:

- [Hello, Wasm!](Tutorial-Hello-Wasm)
- [DOM manipulation](Cheerp-Tutorial-DOM-Manipulation)
- [your first WebAssembly program](WebAssembly-output)
- [a game of Pong in WebAssembly](Cheerp-Tutorial%3A-Mixed-mode-C++-to-WebAssembly-and-JavaScript).

We recommend also reading the [porting guidelines](Porting-guidelines), but there is plenty of interesting materials in this documentation to get back when you will want/need more, some of the most important topics to check out are:

- [jsexport attribute](JavaScript-interoperability)
- Compilation modes tradeoff [JavaScript / Wasm / asm.js](...)
- [Manipulating the DOM](Browser-side-programming-guide)

You can also try Cheerp without installation thanks to this [Cheerp playground](https://cheerp.cppse.nl) by [Ray Burgemeestre](https://github.com/rayburgemeestre).
