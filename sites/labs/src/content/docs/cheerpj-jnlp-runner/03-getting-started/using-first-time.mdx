This tutorial will guide you on the basic functionalities of the JNLP Runner extension. We assume you have installed the extension on [Chrome](/cheerpj-jnlp-runner/getting-started/install-chrome) or [Edge](/cheerpj-jnlp-runner/getting-started/install-edge).

### Before using the extension

The first time you launch a JNLP file to run a Java application, the JNLP Runner will automatically detect it and it will start running. The first screen you will see is the license agreement. Please read this carefully and if you agree with the terms and conditions, click on _**Accept license**_.

## The home screen

When the JNLP Runner extension detects that a JNLP file has been triggered it will show the screen below in a new tab. This screen displays a few options alongside the license's owner and the JNLP filename.

### Manage license button

Click on this button to activate your license key or token. For more information, check the [Activate your license](/cheerpj-jnlp-runner/getting-started/activate-license) tutorial.

### Start application button

If this button is selected, the JNLP Runner will start executing your Java application, you will see a loading screen and after just a few seconds you will see your application running in the browser.

### Download file button

This button starts a download of your JNLP file directly to your machine.

### Start automatically next time

You can skip the home screen and directly start running your Java applications next time by checking this option.
