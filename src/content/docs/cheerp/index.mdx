## What is Cheerp?

Cheerp is a C/C++ compiler to WebAssembly and JavaScript, based on and integrated into the LLVM/Clang infrastructure, and featuring numerous custom optimisation steps to maximise performance and minimise size of the compiled JavaScript/WebAssembly output. Thanks to this, Cheerp is the best performing, most optimised C++ to WebAssembly compiler available on the market.

Cheerp is used primarily to port existing C/C++ libraries and applications to HTML5, but can also be used to write high-performance Web applications and WebAssembly components from scratch. Using Cheerp, C/C++ code gets compiled into JavaScript/WebAssembly and optimised, with the right JavaScript interfaces being exposed, and can easily be integrated in a web application.

Cheerp is licensed under the "Apache 2.0 License with LLVM exceptions", i.e. the same license of upstream LLVM/Clang. This is a permissive license that allows virtually any use of the software.

## What's unique about Cheerp?

Cheerp enables C/C++ code to be compiled to a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript (or asm.js when targeting legacy browsers). Compared to alternative C/C++ compilers for web applications such as Emscripten, Cheerp:

1. Generates more optimized (smaller) WebAssembly code, but can also compile to a JavaScript output with dynamic memory (garbage-collectible output), zero-overhead DOM manipulation and access to Web APIs and superior C++-JavaScript interoperability.
2. Allows to compile a single code base into a combination of WebAssembly and JavaScript by (optionally) tagging portions of the code with `[[cheerp::genericjs]]` and `[[cheerp::wasm]]`.
